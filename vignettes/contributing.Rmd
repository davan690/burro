We want you to help contribute to `burro` - we especially need feedback on 

- Testing the app on as many datasets as possible
- Usability, especially for citizen datasets
- Testing the deployment (which is currently the hardest part)

If you are a novice or beginner, **your feedback is especially important**. Please consider contributing! We'll help you learn the basics of GitHub and make you a good open source collaborator.

If you'd like to contribute, join our mailing list here, or email me at tedladeras@gmail.com and we will get in touch. We'd like to demonstrate and get some feedback
